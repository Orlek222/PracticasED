## Decription for each practice

### First & Second

The objective was to complete the exercises and get in touch with Haskell.

### Third

The objective was to implement the Bag DS by completing SortedLinearBag.hs and BagClient.hs

### Fourth

Same as in the third practice, but in this case, it was the first Java implementation.

### Fifth

This was an exam, which asked the students to implement a Two-Lists Dock in Haskell

### Sixth

This time, we had to complete various files to fully implement the MaxiphobicHeap:

Haskell:
[MaxiphobicHeap.hs](https://github.com/Orlek222/PracticasED/blob/main/Practica6/haskell/DataStructures/Heap/MaxiphobicHeap.hs)

Java:
[MaxiphobicHeap.java](https://github.com/Orlek222/PracticasED/blob/main/Practica6/java/src/dataStructures/heap/MaxiphobicHeap.java)

### Seventh

The point of this one was to implement a Vector type by using a tree.

Haskell:
[TreeVector.hs](https://github.com/Orlek222/PracticasED/blob/main/Practica7/haskell/TreeVector.hs)

Java: UNFINISHED
[TreeVector.java](https://github.com/Orlek222/PracticasED/blob/main/Practica7/java/src/dataStructures/vector/TreeVector.java)


## Exams

In this case, this subject is taught in both Haskell and Java.

For the first mid-term exam, students were asked to implement a Two-Lists Dock in Haskell.

Second exam was to implement a Splay Tree in Java.

The final exam was an implementation of a TreeBitSet in both Java and Haskell.
